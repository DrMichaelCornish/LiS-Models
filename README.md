# LiS-Models
The models used in published research by Michael Cornish will be made available here. Incorporation with the official PyBaMM library will come at a later date. 

# Purpose
This repo contains the models used for Cornish & Marinescu (2021) [currently pre-submission]. Also implemented here are the models published in Hua et al. (2019), Marinescu et al. (2018), and Marinescu et al. (2016).

All models have been implemented in PyBaMM, but please note that this work is not part of the official PyBaMM library. Rather, we utilize the PyBaMM framework and solvers.
